      <h2>'Terping</h2>

      <p>
        I call this section "Terping" (short-hand for "Interpreting") rather than "Emulating" because you often hear about people writing "CHIP-8 emulators" but that's not quite what most such projects are actually doing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's say I want to run the original Atari game <em>Pitfall</em>.

        There's only one problem: I don't have an Atari 2600 to run it on. I could, of course, just re-implement <em>Pitfall</em> to run on the system I want it to. That, of course, would not be running the original but, rather, a derivative based on it. Instead, if I want to run the original on, say, my PC, I would need to emulate the environment in which the original ran.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        In the case of an emulator, I would be choosing not to re-implement the game <em>Pitfall</em> for my native system. Instead, I would re-create the environment with a computer program which allows me to run the original machine code of <em>Pitfall</em>. (You can see some of that <a href="./assets/docs/pitfall-source.pdf">original code</a> if you want!) A benefit of this is that it won't just allow me to run that game, but also any other game developed for the Atari platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the case of Atari, if you wrote an emulator, you would be writing a software implementation of what was a physical system. In the case of something like the CHIP-8 or the Z-Machine, you are implementing something that was never a real machine. These were, instead, virtual machines. The CHIP-8 may have run on a COSMAC VIP, for example, but you don't need to emulate the COSMAC VIP to run a CHIP-8. Similarly, the Z-Machine may have run on a Commodore 64, but you don't need to emulate a Commodore 64 to run a Z-Machine.
      </p>

      <p>
        So let's be clear what the CHIP-8 was: an interpreted programming language/virtual machine specification, not a physical hardware system. It was designed to run on top of existing hardware like the COSMAC VIP, Telmac 1800, and other RCA 1802-based systems. The CHIP-8 "system" provided a standardized, higher-level interface that abstracted away the specifics of the underlying hardware.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you implement CHIP-8 today, you're creating an interpreter that directly executes CHIP-8 bytecode, just like the original CHIP-8 interpreters did on those 1970s machines. You're implementing the CHIP-8 virtual machine specification, not emulating any particular piece of hardware. An actual emulator would simulate the COSMAC VIP's hardware components &mdash; its RCA 1802 CPU, memory layout, I/O systems, etc. &mdash; and then run the original CHIP-8 interpreter program within that emulated environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        This distinction matters because it affects how you approach the implementation. As a CHIP-8 interpreter, you're focused on faithfully implementing the CHIP-8 instruction set and system behavior, rather than worrying about cycle-accurate timing, hardware-specific quirks, or low-level hardware details of the host machines.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus, "CHIP-8 interpreter" is the technically accurate term, even though "CHIP-8 emulator" has become common parlance in retro computing circles.
